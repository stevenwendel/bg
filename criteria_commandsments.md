1. Somatosensory neurons are activated (above baseline) only during the somatosensory period. (test sensitivity to sq wave intensity)

2. A first set of ALM neurons shows sustained activation throughout the instruction and delay periods, and the specific neurons activated during this period predict the upcoming action.

3. A second set of ALM neurons is activated briefly at the time of the Go cue, regardless of the upcoming action.

4. A third set of ALM neurons is activated during the behavioral response, and the specific neurons activated during this period predicts the upcoming action

5. A first set of SNR neurons is inhibited only during the instruction cue and corresponds to the presented cue.

6. A second set of SNR neurons shows sustained activation throughout the instruction and delay periods, and the specific neurons activated during this period predict the upcoming action.

7. A set of VM neurons shows sustained activation throughout the instruction and delay periods, and the specific neurons activated during this period predict the upcoming action.

8. A second set of VM neurons show activation during the behavioral response and the activation corresponds to the chosen action.

9. The subject chooses the behavior that corresponds to the (pre-delay) instruction cue.
