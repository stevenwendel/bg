## Version Control
- 7/21/24
 - updated vpeak function to match Jons. I think it's a bit wonky tbh, but it works now.
- 8/16/24
 - Gave up on using Gaussian smoothing to correlate connectomes. Going back to threshold firing rates as a means to score. Cleaning up and preparing to get a bunch of connectomes and their scores.
- 9/3/24
 - need to work on retrieving matrices that work from the select matrix function (borrow from my randomizer section of old).
 - figure out how to save all the dna with their scores ([my_dna], score)
 - work out selection function
 - work out recombination function
 - should add a way to weight some periods and/or neurons more than others (i.e. VMprep firing at r1 is vitally important). Maybe I can change my 0,0,1,0 validation matrix to numbers that are weights, and then just check == 0 to get the on/off behavior
- 9/19/24
 - Added control condition to validation criteria (made new validation matrix for it; adding scores from experimental and control together to get overall score)
 - **Todo**
   - Allow underlying matrix to mutate as a means to discover new connections
   - Create a class for individual (dna), as well as generation and/or algorithm
- 10/8/24
   - I need to check firing rates across a whole subdivision to determine if its firing
   - I need to compare the firing rates between experimental and control conditions
   - I need to make sure that my network still runs even though I've rearranged this whole thing.
